# Project Enigma

Project Enigma is the Phase 5 continuation of the generated-contract Rogue
adventure loop that began in earlier project branches. The current baseline is a
playable fantasy roguelite deck-and-build RPG prototype focused on readable
buildcraft, generated contracts, deterministic rewards, and gear-driven matchup
decisions.

Phase 5 replaces the old gear assumptions with a five-slot Rogue gear system:
Dagger, Hood, Doublet, Ring, and Necklace. It adds deterministic item
generation, new rarity rules, Cursed and Chaos drawbacks, Unique Specials,
fixed retained Rogue Legendary daggers, reward/shop integration, readable item
cards, Practice Room validation, and Balance Lab coverage.
